Hypothesis

Problems:
1 - Disorganised note-taking and organisation.
2 - Time management.
3 - Remembering links to helpful articles 
4 - Understanding visually where you are in terms of your learning.
5 - Track progress accurately 
6 - Lack of motivation
7 - Lack of confidence (impostor syndrome)

Solutions:
1 - Structured weekly/daily notes app which allows bootcampers to add screenshots, code snippets and notes.
2 - A system where you can write down how much time you’ve spent planning/implementing/deploying OR a pomodoro timer.
3 - Resource Tracker, a blank template to insert your resource links.
4 - Knowledge toggler with a progress bar which takes into consideration the days that were ticked off and the 5 - 5 - 5 - remaining days until the end of the bootcamp.
6 - Daily motivational quotes which have to do with coding/persevering.
7 - Daily reminder that yesterday you didn’t know something (link this to the knowledge toggler.)
